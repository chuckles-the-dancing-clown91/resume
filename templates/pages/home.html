                            <p>Hello! Thank you so much for taking the time to look at my measly resume site!<br>
                                This resume site is built on top of Django with a Postgres backend, Angular HTML rendered front end template,
                                most of the content is Dynamically generated by models I created. So yeah, I can Python
                            </p>
                            <p>Technology has always been a passion of mine, I started off at 13 when Windows XP came out,
                                and I was like "there's gotta be something better, and I stumbled on Linux, Linux Mint 3 Cassandra to be
                                more exact and there was no looking back since. I have since built over 15 small business networks,
                                designed over 3,000 servers and meddled with a plethora of other technologies. I would love to
                                bring my passion to your team and drive our team to success!
                            </p>
                            <small>This is not to showcase my creative skills, I am by no means a front end developer.</small>
